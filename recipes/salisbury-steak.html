    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Salisbury steaks with a savory onion sauce. This yummy recipe has been in my family for years. It's easy to cook but tastes like it took hours to make! I usually make enough extra sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.</p>

        <li>Canned soup</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sauces</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make and shape the patties.</li>
        <li>Brown the patties on both sides, then drain the excess fat.</li>
        <li>Make and season the gravy.</li>
        <li>Pour the gravy over the patties and continue cooking until the meat is cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
